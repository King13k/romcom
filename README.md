# RomCom

An app designed to generate romantic book covers.  
You can randomly choose or create your own cover.
Then save and view your desired covers.

Make sure to use a URL image address in the cover field on the form.
To delete covers from your saved covers view, simply double click.

This is our first paired project in Module one.
